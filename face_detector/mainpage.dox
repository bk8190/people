\b face_detector is a package containing algorithms and nodes related to the detection of faces. 

@section usage Usage
See launch/face_dector.wide.launch to launch in continuous detection mode, or
launch/face_detector_action.wide.launch to launch as an action.

@param classifier_name A readable string name for the classifier. Will be published with the result.
@param classifier_filename Full path to the trained haar cascade. Currently useful cascades are haar_frontalface_alt.xml and haar_profileface.xml in opencv2 
@param classifier_reliability Double 0-1. Some notion of the classifier's reliability for use in a larger system.
@param do_continuous true = Run continuously. false = Wait for action call
@param do_publish_faces_of_unknown_size true = If depth info is not available, publish the resulting face with a position of (0,0,0). false = Don't publish faces if stereo information isn't available.
@param do_display none = Don't display anything. local = Display in an OpenCV window.
@param face_size_min_m Double. The minimum width of a face, in meters. Defaults to 0.1m.
@param face_size_max_m Double. The maximum width of a face, in meters. Defaults to 0.5m.
@param max_face_z_m Double. The maximum distance of a face from the camera, in meters. (In the camera frame, depth is along the z-axis.) Defaults to 8.0m.
@param face_separation_dist_m Double. Only used for tracking. The maximum distance between two face detections before they are considered different faces. Defaults to 1.0m. 



\section codeapi Code API

<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
